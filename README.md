## THE HACKATHON 2020! ü™ì

**First things first! And a very crucial part of the Hackathon, was to come up with the CHEESIEST and PUNNIEST team name... SO ladies and gentleman I introduce our team HACKSTREETS HACK.... üé∂ALLRRIIIGGGHTTüé∂üéµ**

## THE BRIEF:

## THE IDEA! **üí°**
As a team, we looked back at our first three months of TDP,and reflected on what each of us could have used during academy as a supporting tool in our learning. We decided on a community sharing platform. **‚§µÔ∏è** Below is a the introduction to our concept...

## My Hackathon role:
Development Role/Branding & Marketing

## My Contribution
The Hackathon is where I felt that I FINALLY shined in my time at academy, the idea of a Hackathon at first terrified me. My biggest concern was...**IM NOT TECCHY!!** BUUUUTTTT... I actually found firstly that *'Hackathons* are not just for the technically able, and as a result through this i actually had something to bring to the table, and that was my creative side. Thus, I took on the marketing and branding side of things. 

**First the name!** Playing on the factor that the platform was to be a friendly, non-judgy and community based tool, I pitched the name, the rest of the group gave me a thumbs up **üëç** and IT-AMIGOS was now an official brand! 

**Next the Logo!** 
*I reached out to a member from another Hack Team, thanks to @jackpatrickcanning who listened and helped turn an idea in my head into a digital professional logo, below **‚§µÔ∏è** is the final approval.

## Final Thoughts

**Power of Collaboration...

**1)** The most important factor of the Hackathon, is the power of collaboration, it is the key to the success of ideas no matter how *'out-there'* said idea could be. If not for working in a group, I wouldnt have learned about '*wireframes'*, something that we hadnt even touched in academy. just seeing and being introduced to how a wire frame is designed, made logical sense as a web developer.

**2)** Collaboration is not just for your own team, as mentioned I reached outside of my own group for help on the digital logo. After all **(collaboration is key)** and the logo as you can see became central in our presentation **‚§µÔ∏è**

**3)** Working with fellow team members who had training in security concerns, were also key people to learn from. As we hacked together the platform idea on the go, those on the devops stream with recent training were able to identify possible security concerns as we developed along the way e.g. they placed sql injections on the sign up page"


## Additional Contributions...
During Academy I attended a course on UML, *Unified Modelling Language*, where the use of diagrams can visually aid developers and product owners of how a software/system should function, taking what I had learned, I was able to design from another team members  *user stories* a architectural use case story as part of the compilation of information for *would-be* developers. **‚§µÔ∏è**
