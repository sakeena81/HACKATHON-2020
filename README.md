## THE HACKATHON 2020! ü™ì

**First things first! And a very crucial part of the Hackathon, was to come up with the CHEESIEST and PUNNIEST team name... SO ladies and gentleman I introduce our team HACKSTREETS HACK.... üé∂ALLRRIIIGGGHTTüé∂üéµ**

## THE BRIEF:

## THE IDEA! **üí°**
As a team, we looked back at our first three months of TDP,and reflected on what each of us could have used during academy as a supporting tool in our learning. We decided on a community sharing platform. **‚§µÔ∏è** Below is a the introduction to our concept...

## My Hackathon role:
Development Role/Branding & Marketing

## My Contribution
The Hackathon is where I felt that I FINALLY shined in my time at academy, the idea of the Hackathon at first terrified me. My biggest concern was...**IM NOT TECCHY!!** BUUUUTTTT... I actually found I had something to bring to the table, and that was my creative side. The team wanted a unified branding and marketing theme, I had an idea on paper of the overall look. 

**First the name!** Playing on the factor that the platform was to be a friendly, non-judgy and community based tool, I pitched the name, the group gave me a thumbs up **üëç** and IT-AMIGOS was now an official brand! 

**Next the Logo!** 
*below you can see the logo in its final stage. I reached out to a member outside of our team, from another Hack Team, who could help me with turning what was on paper into a digital drawing **(collaboration is key, even in development!)** and he was marvellous in helping me out! So thank you @jackpatrickcanning
