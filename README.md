**First things first! And a very crucial part of the Hackathon, was to come up with the CHEESIEST and PUNNIEST team name... ladies and gentleman I introduce our team HACKSTREETS HACK.... üé∂ALLRRIIIGGGHTTüé∂üéµ**

#### THE BRIEF:

## THE IDEA! **üí°**
As a team, we looked back at our first three months of TDP,and reflected on what each of us could have used during academy as a supporting tool in our learning. We decided on a community sharing platform. **‚§µÔ∏è** Below is a the introduction to our concept...

## My Hackathon role:
Development Role/Branding & Marketing

## My Contribution
The Hackathon is where I felt that I FINALLY shined in my time at academy, the idea of the Hackathon at first terrified me. My biggest concern was...**IM NOT TECCHY!!** BUUUUTTTT... I actually found I had something to bring to the table, and that was my creative side. The team wanted a unified branding and marketing theme, I had an idea on paper of what I wanted something to look like. 

**First the name!** Playing on the factor that the platform was to be a friendly, non-judgy and community based tool, I pitched the name, the group gave me a thumbs up **üëç** and IT-AMIGOS was now an official brand! 

**Next the Logo!** 
*below you can see the logo in its final stage. I reached out to a member outside of our team, from another Hack Team, who could help me with turning what was on paper into a digital drawing (collaboration is key, even in development!) and he was marvellous! @jackpatrickcanning

## What didnt go as planned?



## Possible improvements for future challenges

Javascript I found is harder than initally perceived, but the key is planning. I had not dated my notes from the class meetings, if I had done this, then I would be able to refer faster and easier back to the recordings to follow the instructions and demos, as a result, I was sifting through 4-5 hours of footage per day, to find the exact demonstrations I needed.

Also, more practice is needed, Javascript is all very new to me, but I can see with maybe a few months practice I could complete something similar to this project without having to refer too much to other sources. It would also be a possible consideration for those of us who are not as strong at the tasks, to maybe work in pairs, this gives an oppurtunity of team effort and learning from one another too.
