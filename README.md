## THE HACKATHON 2020! ü™ì

**First things first! And a very crucial part of the Hackathon, was to come up with the CHEESIEST and PUNNIEST team name... SO ladies and gentleman I introduce our team HACKSTREETS HACK.... üé∂ALLRRIIIGGGHTTüé∂üéµ**

## THE BRIEF:

## THE IDEA! **üí°**
As a team, we looked back at our first three months of TDP,and reflected on what each of us could have used during academy as a supporting tool in our learning. We decided on a community sharing platform. **‚§µÔ∏è** Below is a the introduction to our concept...

## My Hackathon role:
Development Role/Branding & Marketing

## My Contribution
The Hackathon is where I felt that I FINALLY shined in my time at academy, the idea of the Hackathon at first terrified me. My biggest concern was...**IM NOT TECCHY!!** BUUUUTTTT... I actually found firstly that *'Hackathons* are not just for the technically able, and as a result through this i actually had something to bring to the table, and that was my creative side. Thus, I took on the marketing and branding side of things. 

**First the name!** Playing on the factor that the platform was to be a friendly, non-judgy and community based tool, I pitched the name, the group gave me a thumbs up **üëç** and IT-AMIGOS was now an official brand! 

**Next the Logo!** 
*below you can see the logo in its final stage. I reached out to a member outside of our team, from another Hack Team, who could help me with turning what was on paper into a digital drawing.  

## The power of Collaboration...
**1)** The most important factor of the Hackathon, is the power of collaboration, it is the key to the success of ideas no matter how *'out-there'* said idea could be. If not for working in a group, I wouldnt have learned about '*wireframes'*, something that we hadnt even touched in academy. just seeing and being introduced to how a wire frame is designed, made logical sense as a web developer.

**2)** Collaboration is not just for your own team, I reached outside of my own group for help on the digital logo. After all **(collaboration is key)** with help from @jackpatrickcanning, he took my rough idea of the logo, and turned it into what you can see below **‚§µÔ∏è**
